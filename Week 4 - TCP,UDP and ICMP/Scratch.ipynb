    "# Assignment: Implementing UDP Protocol Using Basic Socket Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to familiarize yourself with socket programming by implementing the **User Datagram Protocol (UDP)**. You will create both a client and a server application to send and receive messages using UDP sockets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Implementation\n",
    "1. **UDP Server**:\n",
    "   - Create a server program that listens on a specific port.\n",
    "   - The server should wait for messages from the client.\n",
    "   - Once a message is received, the server should send back an acknowledgment message.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **UDP Client**:\n",
    "   - Create a client program that connects to the server.\n",
    "   - The client should send a message to the server and wait for an acknowledgment.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Error Handling**:\n",
    "   - Handle common issues like connection timeouts, invalid inputs, or unexpected termination gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Code Organization**:\n",
    "   - Use separate functions for sending, receiving, and handling data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Requirements\n",
    "1. Use only **basic socket functions** provided in your programming language of choice (e.g., `socket()`, `bind()`, `sendto()`, `recvfrom()` in Python/C).\n",
    "2. The server should be able to handle multiple messages sequentially.\n",
    "3. Include detailed comments in your code explaining each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Testing Across Devices\n",
    "1. Run the server on one machine with its IP address specified.\n",
    "   - Example: `python udp_server.py 192.168.1.2`.\n",
    "2. Run the client on another machine in the same network and provide the server's IP and port. Preferably someone in your wing.\n",
    "   - Example: `python udp_client.py 192.168.1.2 8080`.\n",
    "3. Verify communication works between the two devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Test Cases\n",
    "Prepare the following test cases:\n",
    "- **Valid Input**: Send a normal text message and expect a correct acknowledgment.\n",
    "- **Empty Message**: Send an empty message and check the server's response.\n",
    "- **Long Message**: Test sending a message longer than 1024 bytes to observe behavior.\n",
    "- **Interrupted Connection**: Stop the server while the client is sending data and verify error handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission\n",
    "1. Submit the following:\n",
    "   - Source code for both the client and server.\n",
    "   - A short document (PDF) describing:\n",
    "     - Your implementation approach.\n",
    "     - The challenges you faced and how you solved them.\n",
    "     - Results from your testing, including screenshots of successful communication.\n",
    "2. Upload your submission to the assignment portal.\n",
