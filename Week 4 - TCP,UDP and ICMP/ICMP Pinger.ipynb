    "# ICMP Pinger\n",
    "\n",
    "Ping is a computer network application used to test whether a particular host is reachable across an IP\n",
    "network. It is also used to self-test the network interface card of the computer or as a latency test. It works\n",
    "by sending ICMP “echo reply” packets to the target host and listening for ICMP “echo reply” replies. The\n",
    "\"echo reply\" is sometimes called a pong. Ping measures the round-trip time, records packet loss, and\n",
    "prints a statistical summary of the echo reply packets received (the minimum, maximum, and the mean of\n",
    "the round-trip times and in some versions the standard deviation of the mean).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to develop your own Ping application in Python. Your application will use ICMP but, in\n",
    "order to keep it simple, will not exactly follow the official specification in RFC 1739. Note that you will\n",
    "only need to write the client side of the program, as the functionality needed on the server side is built\n",
    "into almost all operating systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You should complete the Ping application so that it sends ping requests to a specified host separated by\n",
    "approximately one second. Each message contains a payload of data that includes a timestamp. After\n",
    "sending each packet, the application waits up to one second to receive a reply. If one second goes by\n",
    "without a reply from the server, then the client assumes that either the ping packet or the pong packet was\n",
    "lost in the network (or that the server is down)."
